## 💼 Work experience 

**Developer @ Easycon, Brno**; 📅 August 2025 - Present
 - Prepared an semi-automatic upgrade path for OTA update of UniPi over 2 versions of Debian.
   ✅ Impact: Enabled use of Debian 12, improving secutiry and enabled to use newer software packages.
 - Resolved race-condition in a project with multiple subprocesses:
   ✅ Impact: Complete elimination
   of sporadic corruption of mmaped regions of memory, improving reliability and resource utilization.
 - Implemented parallelized reading from Modbus devices:
   ✅ Impact: Enabled efficient data collection 
   from multiple devices, improving performance and scalability of the system.
 - Added type-checking hints and `pydantic` object models.
   ✅ Impact: Preventing introduction of errors,
   IDE provides more relevant suggestions, better documentation of configuration structure,
   and improved maintainability of the codebase.
 - Restructured the project and changed python `import` statements to absolute imports of whole modules.
   ✅ Impact: Improved maintainability, IDE support, reduced risk of circular imports, enabled faster code navigation
   and thus faster onboarding of new developers.
 - Implemented unit-tests using `pytest` and GitHub Actions.
   ✅ Impact: Base for future refactoring of the codebase
   to decrease internal coupling and increase maintainability, and help preventing regressions in the future.
 - Found the root-cause of a memory leak in production code.
